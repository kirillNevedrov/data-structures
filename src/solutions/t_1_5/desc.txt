info:

one edit away
types of edits: insert, delete, replace character

example:

input: "test", "tes"
output: True 

input: "test", "best"
output: True 

input: "test", "belt"
output: False

brute force: 
find string with max length, 
check that another string has similar length or one character shorter, 

make counter of characters for first strings, 
go through same counters and count to negative direction for second string

calculate sum of positive and sum of negative
if both != 0, then reduce both abs values by 1 as a replace
then check that sum of abs values is equal or less than 1

time: O(n + m)
space: O(n + m)

optimized:
we could use array of integers instead of dictionary, 
O() estimations will not change

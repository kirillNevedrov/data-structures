info:

first common ancestor of two nodes in binary tree

do not use additional dat structure




example:

         7
    4         2
  9   91    0    11
2


brute force:

depth first
start from root and check if node is ancestor of two nodes, 
for last common ancestor save distance to first and distance to second
if next is lower by at least one then iit is new common ancestor

time: O(n log n) log n nodes checked as if node if not correct we do not go deeper, but for each node we could check each node
space: O(1)

optimized:

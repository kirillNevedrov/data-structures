info:

two sorted arrays A nad B

A has large enough buffer at the end for brute

merge B into A in sorted order

example:

A: [1, 4, 6, 8, 10]
B  [3, 7, 90]

brute force:

go through two arrays with two pointers and add smallest value of two to new array and poving pointer of smallest value

time: O(m + n)
space: O(m + n)

optimized:

go through A from right to left, with two ponters: read and write, in parallel g throug B from left to right with one read pointer
move write pointer on each step, and move read pointer of smallest as before

tiem: O(m + n)
space: O(1)

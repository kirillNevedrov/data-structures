info:

100 floors

if drop egg from N or above floor, then it will break

from floors below N it will not break

you have two eggs

find N with minimal number of drops

example:

brute force:

just drop egg from every floor from first, when it breaks floor is N

number of drops ~ N


optimized:

1.
we can move by step of two, then if egg breaks, then we drop second egg from prev floor to check if it is n

number of drops ~ N/2

2.
we can try to balance prev solution 

like go by step of 10, but then go 10 steps with second egg

what is the optimal balance is case of 100 floors for worst case? it means we need to minimize maximum possible number of drops

if 14: 21

if 13: 20

if 12: 20

if step is 11: 20

if step is 10 then maximum possible is: 20

if step is 9, then max is: 20

if 8: 20

if 7: 21

if 5: 25





2.1
also step could be dynamic like with binary search

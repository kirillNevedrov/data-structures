info:

linked list

move all nodes less then vlue x before all nodes that greater or equal
order of nodes in two partitions is not important


example:

input 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1, 5 
output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

brute force: 

create two linked list on consists of elements less than x, 
other consists of elements greater or equal to x
then just assign root of second list as next on lest element of first LinkedList

time: O(n)
space: O(1) because we just create empty lists and reassign pointer to them

optimized:

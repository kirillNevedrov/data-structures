info:

unsorted linked list,
remove duplicates
temporary buffer is not allowed

example:

input: 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> 1 -> 100 -> 3
output: 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3 -> 100

brute force:
go through list and for each element go through list one more time and remove all the duplicates of the element

time: O(n^2)
space: O(1)


optimized: 

sort linked list first, then go through list and remove all the elements that similar to prev

time: O(nlogn)
space: O(1)

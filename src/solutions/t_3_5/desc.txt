info:

sort stack, 
smallest at the top
you can use additional temp stack, not other data structures allowed

stack operations:
pop, push, peek, is_empty

example:

imput:

-> 1, 3, 5, 76, 2, 3, 1, 14, 9
<-

output:

-> 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 9, 14, 76
<-

brute force: 
pop all elements from stack to other stack and calc min one, save its index, then add all except this one(by index) back and add min one at the end

do this until value of last one is equal to max

time: O(n^2)
space: O(n)

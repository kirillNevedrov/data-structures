info:

given:

2 ants on different vertices of triangle

they start walking on the sides of triangle

each ant randomly picks direction

probabilities of directions is similar

they walk on the same speed



task:

find probability of collisiosn between any two of them

additional task:
find probability of collision of n ants on n-vertex polygon

example:

brute force:

we need to find probability of event that any to go to different direction

we can calculate all possible events and find portion of event when any to go to different direction

we can consider each ant as binary number with possible values 0 and 1

then we can consider sequence of 3 bits 

in total we can have 2*2*2=8 combinations and they go to different directions only when sequnces 000 or 111 so 2 cases

so probability of collision is (8-2)/8=3/4  (2^n - 2)/2^n = 1 - 2/2^n = 1 - 2^(1-n) = 1 - 1/2^(n-1)

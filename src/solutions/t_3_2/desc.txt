info:

stack

add min operation that returns min element

push pop min time complexity O(1) 

example:

input:
1
4
3
5
output: 1

input:
3
4
2
5
output: 2


brute force: 
go through the stack and return min element, time: O(n), space: O(1)

optimized:

each element keep minimum of its substack -> all element beneath it includin itself

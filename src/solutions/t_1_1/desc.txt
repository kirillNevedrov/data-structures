example:

input: "antops"
output: True

input: "antopts"
output: False

brute force: for each character check the rest of characters in the string. time: O(n^2), space O(1)
optimized: sort string first, then go through string and check if next character if similar to current one. time: O(n*logn), space: O(1)

find heavy bottle



example:

brute force:

options:

- take bottle randomly and meausre, then we have 1/20 chance and we do not know which weight is hevier and which is liter if we only have one measure

- take one pill from each then we again have 1/20 chance but measure will say us is it heavy bottle or not

- take pills from multiple bottles and measure them will say us if we have heavy bottle in sample or not

  if we take pills from 10 bottles we have 1/10 chance to find havy bottle

- we take 1 pill from first, two pills from second, etc., we can calculate expected wight if all 1 g it is 1+ 2+ 3+ 4 ... + 20 = 210, then we can extract from our weight 210 and devide by 0.1 to get number

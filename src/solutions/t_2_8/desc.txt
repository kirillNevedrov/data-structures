linked list

detect loop and return first element of the loop


example:

input A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C(same C as earlier)
output: C

brute force: 

go through list for each node go to the end to check if similar node exists 
if so return that node

time: O(n^2)
space: O(1)

optimized: 

we can save each node to set than just check if it exists in set
time: O(n)
space: O(n)

if we have loop we will eventually go back to fisr loop element, so we just need to undertsnad that we alrady visited that node

does not work as linked list node is not heshable

optimized:

while we go through list we just check next to our own test node, when we arrive to test node it means thatprevious is loop node

time: O(n)
space: O(1)

info:

exaplain how would you test the method

example:

class Piece:
     def can_move_to(self, x: int, y: int) -> bool:
          ...

solution:

normal test cases:

take coordinates inside allowed and not allowed move

test_returns_true_for_allowed_move

test_returns_flase_for_not_alloed_move

extremes:

take coordinates on the edges of allowed and not allowed move

test_returns_true_for_allowed_move

test_returns_flase_for_not_alloed_move

nulls amd illegal:

nulls can be covered by type hint, it is still possible to pass null to method but in this case it is ok that it crashes if it does not cuase any critical consequnces

test_raises_error_for_coordinates_out_of_borad

info:

compute permutations of string of unique characters


example:

input: cat

output: cat, cta, act, atc, tca, tac


brute force:

recursive appraoch

calc all permutations for one character - it is just one character

for second set next letter to all existing indexes and append to the end

time: O(n! + n-1! + n-2! + ...) ~ O(n^2*n!)

space O(n)

info:

matrix M * N

if element is 0 then set entire row and column to 0's 

example:

input: [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [17, 5, 91],
    [0 , 0 , 1000]
]

output: [
    [1, 0, 3],
    [17, 0, 91],
    [0 , 0 , 0]
]

brute force: 
go through matrix an collect indexes of all 0 items
then for each 0 element set its row and column to 0's

time: O(M*N*(M + N)) = O(N*M^2 + M*N^2)
space: O(M*N)

optimized: 

we can set elements to zeros in O(M*N) so entire time should be O(M*N)

we can collect all zero rows and coluns in hash sets and then set them to zeros 

time O(m*n + m*n + n*m)
space: O(m + n)

optimized:
instead of set of integers we could use array of booleans or even bitmap (for short length only <= 32), but it will not chnage an estimation

info:

implement queue which uses two stacks internally

example:

queue:
<- 1 2 3 9 5 2 3 0 89 <-

stack: 
-> 1 2 3 9 5 2 3 0 89
<-

q:
0

s:
0

q:
0 6

s:
6 0

q:
0 6 7

s:
7 6 0

operations:
add 
remove

brute force: 
when we add new element we pop all the elements to other stack then add new element then add all existing elements

variation: write as usual, but on read copy to other stack and pop from it

add
time: O(n)
space: O(n)

remove
time: O(1)
space: O(1)

optimized:

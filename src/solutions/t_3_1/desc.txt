info:

use sigle array to implemet three stacks

example:



brute force: 
for first stack adresses use i * 3
for second stack adresses use (i * 3) + 1
for third stack adresses use (i * 3) + 2

when we add element to last stack we init prev stacks values by None

when we delete element from first stack we just set it to None

we can also separately manage size/last index of each stack to make all the operations in O(1)

optimized:
